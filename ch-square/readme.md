# Problem Statement
This test checks whether a sequence of pseudo-random numbers in [0,1] are uniformity
distributed. The chi-square test, in general, can be used to check whether an empirical
distribution follows a specific theoretical distribution. In this case, we are concerned
about testing whether the numbers produced by a generator are uniformly distributed.
